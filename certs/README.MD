# How to create Load Balancer certificates

The Load Balancing service does not generate SSL certificates. It can only import an existing certificate that you already own. The certificate can be one issued by a vendor, such as Verisign or GoDaddy. You can also use a self-signed certificate that you generate with an open source tool

This document will explain how to create your SSL certificates for the load balancer using your own CA  self signed certificate.
